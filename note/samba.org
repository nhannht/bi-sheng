* On centos 7:
** Install samba: dùng một trong 2 cách sau
   + yum install samba

     
   + yum repoquery --location samba |xargs wget |rpm -i samba.*.rpm

   +  ngoài ra một số distro cần thêm sambaclient và một số dependences khác ta cũng làm tương tự.
** Set up samba:
   + Trên linux, ta tạo file /etc/config/smb.conf vì samba không mặc định file này
   + Ta cũng có thể copy/download smb.conf example từ trên internet, nguồn uy tín nhất là từ chính source code của samba: [[https://git.samba.org/samba.git/?p=samba.git;a=blob_plain;f=examples/smb.conf.default;hb=HEAD][smb.conf examble]]

   + Ta config một số thứ trên samba.conf
     - log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log #vì mặc đinh samba chỗ này là một dir không có quyền write, nếu ta không phân quyền sẽ xảy ra bug.
     - smb.conf mẫu đạt ở cuối bài  [[id:71a86ed6-3b15-4ecd-a718-1cd1d0cf79b2][here]]

     # This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
     # smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
     # here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
     # many!) most of which are not shown in this example
     #
     # For a step to step guide on installing, configuring and using samba, 
     # read the Samba-HOWTO-Collection. This may be obtained from:
     #  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf
     #
     # Many working examples of smb.conf files can be found in the 
     # Samba-Guide which is generated daily and can be downloaded from: 
     #  http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/Samba-Guide.pdf

     # Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)

     # may wish to enable
     #

     # to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors.
